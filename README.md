## create environment

```bash
$pip3 install -r requirements.txt 
$python3 game.py
```

## How to

1. Initialise Game object.
2. Use functions, go wild.
3. You need to create a loop, like in main.py because the game is turn based.

## Only function you will need to access from "Game" object I think.
